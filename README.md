# Simon Game

This is a project tutorial for my web development course

# Rule
Basically, to play this game you just need to see which button that blinks. Then, after sucesfully click on the right button, the sequence of the button will increase. You will need to maintain your sequence streak as much as you can. If you incorrectly press a button that is not in the sequence, the game will end and you need to start over again.
